Our newly proposed dataset will be made available here soon. The dataset will be provided for research purpose only.

### Trajectory Predicition for Normal Samples
The proposed model is able to predicit future human pose trajectories sucessfuly for normal pedestrain activities. 

### Trajectory Predicition for Abnormal Samples
The proposed model generates large deviations for prediciton of human pose trajectories corresponding to abnormal activities. 


### Corridore Dataset
In order to benchmark existing techniques for the task of abnormal activity detection we also introduce a new data-set, which consists of group activities such as protest, chasing, fighting, sudden running as well as single person activities such as hiding face, loitering, unattended baggage, carrying a suspicious object and cycling (in a pedestrian area). We believe such a
dataset will motivate investigations for human activity analysis to consider single human or multi-human interaction. We name it the Corridor dataset. The Corridor is a large scale surveillance dataset with 4,83,566 frames.
